## Dependency
A software called Mindmaster

MindMaster is a user-friendly software about drawing mindmaps. It helps me a lot to sort the basis of any things that I want to learn. I love designing, when I use draw the mindmaps, I find it so interesting that I am not lazy on learning anymore.

SO the repository is all about the completing versions of the mindmap.
